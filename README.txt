README: By Matthew Bradley (bradleym3@wit.edu) -- Mar 29 2019

HMLR.ZIP contains my R code for a 1 step Bayesian Hierarchy on the traditional Hastings-Metropolis Algorithm. It also contains a number of auxiliary files I created in an attempt to fine tune the parameters of the model. In this code, I use the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm to perform logistic regression on a test set of data. 

The main R file should contain a rather thorough (in my opinion) description of the concepts behind the process in the comments. 

This project is still under development and may see future changes. The code in its current state still needs tuning to be considered accurate or usable in a practical sense. I also intend on correcting any errors I may have made in the comments describing the process happening in the code. 

I also intend on indexing and describing each auxiliary piece of code I wrote in the near future.
